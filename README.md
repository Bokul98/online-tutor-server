## Technology Stack

### Backend (Server)
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web application framework
- **MongoDB** - Database for storing application data
- **Mongoose** - MongoDB object modeling
- **Firebase Admin SDK** - User authentication and management

### NPM Packages Used

#### Core Dependencies
- **express** (^5.1.0) - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **mongodb** (^6.17.0) - Official MongoDB driver
- **mongoose** (^8.15.1) - MongoDB object modeling tool
- **firebase-admin** (^13.4.0) - Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- **jsonwebtoken** (^9.0.2) - JWT implementation for authentication
- **cors** (^2.8.5) - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware
- **dotenv** (^16.5.0) - Environment variable management

#### Development Dependencies
- **nodemon** (^3.1.10) - Development server with auto-restart functionality

## JWT Authentication Implementation

### üîë Authentication Flow
The platform implements a comprehensive JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication system:

1. **Token Creation**: Upon successful login (both email/password and social login), a JWT token is generated server-side
2. **Client-Side Storage**: The JWT token is stored on the client side (localStorage/sessionStorage)
3. **Token Transmission**: The token is sent with each API request via Authorization header
4. **Server-Side Verification**: JWT middleware verifies the token on protected routes
5. **Route Protection**: Private routes are secured using JWT authentication middleware

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features
- **Token Verification**: All private routes verify JWT tokens before granting access
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Support for both email/password and social login authentication
- **Error Handling**: Optional implementation of 401 (Unauthorized) and 403 (Forbidden) responses
- **Middleware Protection**: Custom JWT middleware for route-level security

### üîí Protected Routes
Routes that require JWT authentication:
- `/api/tutorials/my-tutorials` - Get user's tutorials
- User profile management endpoints
- Booking creation and management
- Tutorial creation and editing (user-specific)

### User Management
- `POST /api/users` - User registration and management
- Authentication endpoints for login/logout

### Booking Management
- `GET /api/booked` - Get booking information
- `POST /api/booked` - Create new booking
- Booking management endpoints
